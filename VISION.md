## Motivation
This whole project came together as an experiment for me to get better at my coding skills and at the end have something to test my knowledge of German vocabulary (very poor). I know there are better apps and sites implementing flash card style of testing, however my goal was to try to push myself to do some coding project and this topic happened to be my other hobby. Any feedback is therefore welcomed! 

## Future plans
Implementation of comparing flashcard prompt with the answer can be later changed with 'the dufficulty level' when testing. However now, it is mostly fitted for German. Mostly considering articles with noun with partially right answer also with wrong article. 
Later change can be adding an option of reading vocabulary from a file. For now I prefer to put them in manually as a way of 'learning'.
