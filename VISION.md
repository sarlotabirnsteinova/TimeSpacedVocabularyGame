## Motivation
This project came together as an experiment for me to enhance my coding skills and at the end to have something to test my proficiency in German vocabulary (very poor). While I'm aware of more sophisticated applications and websites that employ flashcard-style testing, my goal was to challenge myself with a coding project and this topic happened to allign with my other hobby. Any constructive feedback is therefore welcomed! 

## Future plans
The current implementation, which compares flashcard prompts with answers, could potentially evolve into a system that incorporates a 'difficulty level' during testing and specific features depending on a target language. Now, the application is tailored predominantly for the German language. Mostly by considering articles with nouns and including cases where the answer might be partially correct even when incorrect article is provided in answer.
A future modification may involve an option of reading vocabulary from a file. For now, I prefer to put them in manually, as it serves as a complementary method of learning. As the project progresses, additional features and refinements are anticipated. Therefore, any inputs and wishes are welcomed!
