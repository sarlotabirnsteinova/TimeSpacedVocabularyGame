# TimeSpacedVocabularyGame
Game for testing vocabulary in your target language.

It is a flashcard type of testing, with an extra feature of flashcards appearing with decreasing frequency (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

There are two different versions of this game, one is meant for learning and the other for testing vocabulary.
## Learning vocabulary
It is meant for adding new vocabulary to your flashcard deck.

## Testing vocabulary
It will test vocabulary from your deck according to your previous performance and the time since the last testing. 
In the case of correct answers while testing, one flashcard appears the day of testing, the next day, after two weeks, after a month, and the last time after three months, after which the expression is considered learned.
